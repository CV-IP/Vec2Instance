# Vec2Instance

In this paper, we describe a new deep convolutional neural network architecture called \mbox{Vec2Instance} for instance segmentation. \mbox{Vec2Instance} provides a framework for parametrization of instances, allowing convolutional neural networks to efficiently estimate the complex shapes of instances around their centroids. We demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed architecture with respect to instance segmentation tasks on satellite images, which have a wide range of applications. Moreover, we demonstrate the usefulness of the new method for extracting building foot-prints from satellite images.
